I am a fina-year Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Stuttgart]() and the [Intl. Max Plank Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS)](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/), Germany, under the guidance of [Prof. Steffen Staab](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5xf8n2/professor-steffen-staab). During my PhD, I was funded by the [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie PhD Fellowship](). 


My research centres on AI and machine learning, with a special emphasis on advancing the **representation** of human knowledge. I explore two core paradigms of knowledge representation:
<br>
1) **Symbolic representation**: Graphs, knowledge graphs, ontologies, etc. 
<br>
2) **Neural representation**: Large language models (LLMs), embeddings. 

By bridging these two forms of representations (neuro-symbolic), I aim to develop **reliable** and **interpretable AI** models allowing for learning, reasoning, and adapting across diverse domains (e.g., **biomedicine & health**).
