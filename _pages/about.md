I am a computer science Ph.D. candidate at International Max Plank Research School for Intelligent Systems ([IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)), as well as a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Early Stage Researcher at the Department of Computer Science, [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/), Germany, under the supervision of [Prof. Steffen Staab](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5xf8n2/professor-steffen-staab). Before this, I obtained my B.Sc. and M.Eng. degrees from [Beijing Jiaotong University](), Beijing, China, where I did wonderful research internships at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) and [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/).

My research centres on machine learning on relational and graph-structured data. In particular, I am interested in developing geometry inspired models (e.g., geometric inductive biases) for the representation and reasoning of relational/graph-structured data.
