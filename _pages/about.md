I am a Machine Learning Researcher at Twitter, as well as PhD student at Imperial College London, working on Graph Neural Networks and supervised by [Prof. Michael Bronstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bronstein). Before joining Twitter I was working at Fabula AI, which was then [acquired by Twitter](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/twitter-bags-deep-learning-talent-behind-london-startup-fabula-ai/) in June 2019. Previously, I completed an MPhil at the University of Cambridge and a BEng at Imperial College London, both in Computer Science. 

I am also the co-founder of [LeadTheFuture](https://leadthefuture.tech/), a non-profit mentoring organization founded in 2018, and the largest merit-based STEM community in Italy. Today LeadTheFuture counts more than [150 mentors](https://leadthefuture.tech/i-nostri-mentor/) (engineers, researchers and entrepreneurs) and 500 selected mentees.
