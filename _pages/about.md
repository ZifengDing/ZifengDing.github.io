I am a computer science Ph.D. candidate at International Max Plank Research School for Intelligent Systems ([IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)), as well as a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Early Stage Researcher at [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/), Germany, under the supervision of [Prof. Steffen Staab](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5xf8n2/professor-steffen-staab). 

My research centres on machine learning on relational and graph-structured data. 
In particular, I am interested in developing models that draw inspiration from geometry to represent these types of data. The core aim of my research is to devise techniques that transform discrete or structured objects into continuous geometric spaces, thereby enabling the seamless integration of differentiable learning and reasoning methodologies.
