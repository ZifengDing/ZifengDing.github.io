I am a fina-year Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Stuttgart]() and the [Intl. Max Plank Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS)](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/), Germany, under the guidance of [Prof. Steffen Staab](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5xf8n2/professor-steffen-staab). During my PhD, I was funded by the [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie PhD Fellowship](). 

My research centres on machine learning within symbolic and structured domains, with a special emphasis on modeling complex structured data including networks, knowledge graphs, and ontologies. For this purpose, I am conducting fundamental and interdisciplinary research in graph/relational ML, neuro-symbolic AI, knowledge representation, and foundation models.
