I am a computer science Ph.D. candidate at Intl. Max Plank Research School for Intelligent Systems ([IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)), as well as a Marie Curie Early Stage Researcher at Department of Computer Science, University of Stuttgart, Germany, under the supervision of [Prof. Steffen Staab](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5xf8n2/professor-steffen-staab). 
Before this, I obtained my BEng and MEng degrees from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, where I did several wonderful internships at [Baidu Inc.](http://research.baidu.com/), [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](https://www.noahlab.com.hk/#/home), and [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/).

My research interests focus on machine learning on relational data and geometric deep learning. Currently, I am interested in developing geometrically/mathematically inspired models for representation learning over relational/structured data, including knowledge graph embeddings and graph neural networks.
