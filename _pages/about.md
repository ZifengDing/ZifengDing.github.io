I am a fina-year Ph.D. candidate at the International Max Plank Research School for Intelligent Systems ([IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)) and the University of Stuttgart, Germany. I am supervised by [Prof. Steffen Staab](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5xf8n2/professor-steffen-staab) and was funded by the Marie Curie PhD Fellowship.

My research centres on machine learning in the symbolic/structured domains, with a special focus on modeling data with complex structure (e.g., social networks, knowledge graphs, and biomedical ontologies). 
For this purpose, I am conducting fundamental research in geometric representation learning, graph/relational ML, neuro-symbolic AI, and foundation models.
