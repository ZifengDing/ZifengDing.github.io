I am a fina-year Ph.D. candidate at International Max Plank Research School for Intelligent Systems ([IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)), as well as a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Early Stage Researcher at [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/), Germany, under the supervision of [Prof. Steffen Staab](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5xf8n2/professor-steffen-staab). 

My research centres on machine learning with a special focus on relational and graph-structured data (e.g., social/biomedical networks and knowledge graphs). 
Specifically, I am developing geometric embedding models that faithfully model the discrete properties inherent in the graph-structured data.
