I am a Machine Learning Researcher at Twitter, as well as a PhD student at Imperial College London, working on Graph Neural Networks and supervised by [Prof. Michael Bronstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bronstein). Before joining Twitter I was working at Fabula AI, which was then [acquired by Twitter](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/twitter-bags-deep-learning-talent-behind-london-startup-fabula-ai/) in June 2019. Previously, I completed an MPhil at the University of Cambridge and a BEng at Imperial College London, both in Computer Science. 

I like to focus on [research](../research/) that is directly applicable to the real-world. This is why I prefer solutions which are simple (to understand and implement) and extremely scalable. For an example, see our [SIGN model](https://towardsdatascience.com/simple-scalable-graph-neural-networks-7eb04f366d07), which is currently used in production at [Airbnb](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/graph-machine-learning-at-airbnb-f868d65f36ee) to improve their trust & safety service predictions.

I am also the co-founder of [LeadTheFuture](https://leadthefuture.tech/), a non-profit mentoring organization founded in 2018, and the largest merit-based STEM community in Italy. Today LeadTheFuture counts more than [150 talented mentors](https://leadthefuture.tech/i-nostri-mentor/) (engineers, researchers and entrepreneurs) and over 500 selected mentees. As a recognition for our work, my co-founders and I have been selected as part of [Forbes 100 under 30 List Italy](https://forbes.it/classifiche-forbes/under-30/forbes-under-30-education-2020-i-migliori-giovani-talenti-italiani/) in the Education category.
