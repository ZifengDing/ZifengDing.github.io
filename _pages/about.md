I am a computer science Ph.D. candidate at Intl. Max Plank Research School for Intelligent Systems ([IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)), as well as a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Early Stage Researcher at the Department of Computer Science, [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/), Germany, under the supervision of [Prof. Steffen Staab](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5xf8n2/professor-steffen-staab). 
I received my B.Sc. and M.Eng. degrees from [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://en.njtu.edu.cn/), Beijing, China.  

My research centres on machine learning on relational and graph-structured data. 
In particular, I am interested in developing geometric methods for relational representation and reasoning.

- ML on relational/graph-structured data 
- ML with prior symbolic/relational knowledge
- Geometric inductive biases (e.g., hyperbolic geometry)
