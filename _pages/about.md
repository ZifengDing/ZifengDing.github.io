I am a fina-year Ph.D. candidate at International Max Plank Research School for Intelligent Systems ([IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)) and the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/), Germany, under the supervision of [Prof. Steffen Staab](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5xf8n2/professor-steffen-staab), and funded by the Marie Sklodowska-Curie PhD Fellowship (2020-2023).

My research centres on machine & representation learning with a special focus on modeling and understanding data with complex structure (e.g., networks and knowledge graphs).
