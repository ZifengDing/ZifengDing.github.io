I am a computer science Ph.D. candidate at Intl. Max Plank Research School for Intelligent Systems ([IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)), as well as a Marie Curie Early Stage Researcher at Department of Computer Science, University of Stuttgart, Germany, under the supervision of [Prof. Steffen Staab](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5xf8n2/professor-steffen-staab). 

My research centres on machine learning on relational & structured data. In particular, I am interested in developing geometrically/mathematically inspired models for representation learning over relational data.

- ML on relational data (e.g., knowledge graphs)
- ML with prior symbolic knowledge
- Geometric inductive biases (e.g., hyperbolic geometry)
